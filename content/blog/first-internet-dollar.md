<!-- Build a SaaS - Chat Analyzer -->
I built <a href="https://chatanalyzer.app" target="_blank" style="color:#4285F4;">ChatAnalyzer</a> three months ago as my first attempt to break into a SaaS business.

It is basically a *"Chat with PDF"* web app, but instead of a PDF, it uses a WhatsApp conversation as the data source.

It has been fun, and I've learned a lot, but it didn't really make any money, not until June 1st, when I suddenly got this notification.

</div>

<!-- 100 registered users - 1 user pays -->
It is not much, not even enough to cover the domain name purchase lol ðŸ˜‚. But that's okay, I didn't expect my first SaaS to succeed anyway.

To be honest, I didn't really focus on growing it for the last couple of weeks because of work and other projects, I just let it run on autopilot.

But I guess having 115 users willing to register to use the service that you built is also another win ðŸ˜Š.

<!-- Feeling -->
At least now I can feel what other indie hackers often mention, earning your first internet dollar ðŸ¤‘.

To many more dollars in the future! ðŸ’µðŸ’µðŸ’µ.
