<!-- Job offer -->
I had several job interviews in the past few months.

Well, I'm not actively looking for a job though, I am just testing the water, and looking to see if there are any better opportunity.

Luckily, I received an offer from one of my dream companies. 

At first, they offered a 30% salary increase, but after I negotiated, they raised it to 40% ðŸ¤‘.

That's a huge bump, I honestly never thought I would reach this level of income so quickly, and <b>all I did was just one simple thing, ask</b>.

This reminds me of one of the funniest TED Talks, in my opinion, where the speaker talked about rejection. You should check it out --> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vZXgApsPCQ" target="_blank">What I learned from 100 days of rejection | Jia Jiang</a>

<!-- Explain how to I always kinda receiving things -->
Growing up, I wasn't the person who always challenged things. I guess I have always just accepted what life throws at me.

Yes, it gave me more peace, but I think sometimes I missed out on potentially big opportunities.

I'm glad it has been slowly changing.
