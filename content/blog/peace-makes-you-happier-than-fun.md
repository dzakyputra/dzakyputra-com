<!-- Background -->
I saw this quote on Twitter yesterday. I could relate to it on a certain levelâ€”having hobbies and routines that most people call boring or label as not 'fun'. But honestly, thatâ€™s where I feel the happiest.

<!-- Different meaning of peace, fun, happiness -->
I understand that peace, fun, and happiness mean different things to different people. But Iâ€™m pretty sure most wouldnâ€™t call staying in all weekend in front of your computer a 'fun' activity ðŸ˜‚.

"You should go out!"

"Go clubbing or hit a party!"

"Travel the world!"

â€” Thatâ€™s what they usually say.

Well actually, I do go outâ€”trying new activities, cafes, or foodâ€”but mostly when friends ask me first ðŸ˜….

As for clubbing and partying? Not really my thing, too many people.

Traveling the world? Honestly, I want that tooâ€”but right now, it doesnâ€™t feel like the wisest choice financially for me.

My week-to-week activities are mostly the same. I go to work during the weekdaysâ€”hit the gym afterward or go for a morning run. I eat almost the same thing every day and do some productive coding sessions on the weekends.

<!-- Why I do boring routines? -->
<h1 style="margin-top: 2rem;"> Why I Do <span style="font-style: italic;"> Boring </span> Routines? </h1>
I have always been a simple man, and I try to choose the simplest way to do thingsâ€”even if it looks boring to everyone else.

Well, boring routines arenâ€™t so badâ€”they save you energy and money, and honestly, saving money is the best part.

As a not-so-privileged salaryman working in a third-world country without a solid government pension plan, saving and investing early as much as possible can give you a better sense of security in the future, and hopefully give you more freedom later in lifeâ€”at least that's my plan.

And after 7 years of consistently saving and investing from my salary, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m really happy with where I am at right now.

I think thatâ€™s one of the reasons I actually enjoy doing those boring routinesâ€”because deep down, I know Iâ€™m doing it to give myself more freedom in the future.

<!-- Approaching My 30s -->
<h1 style="margin-top: 2rem;"> Approaching My 30s </h1>
But I understand that as life goes on, people changeâ€”and maybe I will too. 

Iâ€™ll be turning 30 next year, and I can already feel my perspective shifting.

I chose to do my productive weekend session from a cafÃ© instead of my bedroomâ€”and it worked. I felt way more productive, got more writing done, and even finished my long-overdue side project.

One day, I took a different running route just for fun and ended up finding a coconut water stallâ€”something I have been craving after every run.

Then I said yes to a friendâ€™s invitation to play tennis. I rediscovered how much I enjoy it.

I can see myself slowly saying 'yes' more often to new possibilities and opportunities, and honestly, itâ€™s starting to feel really great.
