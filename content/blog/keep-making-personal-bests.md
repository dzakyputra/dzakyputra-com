<!-- Background i am running -->
I started running around 2016. I remember that I used to run on the field in front of my university hall in the evening after classes. 

Not many people ran back then, at least not in Yogyakarta where I studied.

<!-- First event at 2017 and my PB -->
Then I participated in my first running event, it was the <a href="https://www.bankmandiri.co.id/en/news-detail?primaryKey=38496&backUrl=/search%3Fkeywords%3DMy%20name%20is%20MT4WhatsApp%EF%BC%9A%2085294399212%26searchCategory%3D0" target="_blank">Mandiri Jogja Marathon 2017</a> where I ran the 5K, with an official time of **35:00, or a 7:00 min/km pace**. I remember it exactly because the time was a round number 😅. Oh, and I almost vomited at the finish line LOL.

I never knew my personal best time before, I ran simply because I wanted to. I didn't care about the pace, I didn't even know what that was back then. I didn't care what shoes I was wearing, I even ran barefoot my first time 🤣.

<!-- Fast forward to 2025 and my PB -->
Two weeks ago, almost exactly on the same date as my first running event, I recorded a new personal best for the 5K. It was **23:47, or a 4:45 min/km pace**. 

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

I never thought I'd hit that number when I first started running, but I guess I've been improving slowly all these years.

<!-- Reflection on how we need to keep track of things we want to improve -->
I wonder what other things I've been improving at without realizing it, just because I haven't been tracking them. Do I get better at work? Do I get better as a friend? Do I get better at being a human in general? Well, I guess it's a great idea for an app 🧐.

<!-- Keep improving -->
Hitting that number felt awesome, it was like a reminder to me to **keep making personal bests**, not only in running, but in every aspect of my life.

Isn't that what life is about, being a better version of yourself every day?
