<!-- Dari kecil, setiap 3-4 tahun sekali selalu ada hal baru (pindah) -->
When people asked me where I came from, I was never sure how to answer. 

That's because since I was a kid, I kept moving from one city to another every two to four years due to my parents' job.

'Hometown' was a strange concept for me, even until now.

When I moved to a new city, the discomfort kicks in. Having to navigate a new place, meet strangers, and not knowing anyone, it sucks.

<!-- This week start my new job, feeling uncomfortable again -->
For the past two weeks, I have felt it again, the unfamiliarity and discomfort of a new place (I started a new job).

I guess my two-to-four-year cycle keeps going, and I'm facing a new environment all over again.

<!-- Haruskah merasa uncomfortable untuk growth? kalau berada di zona nyaman selamanya? -->

Over time, I guess the discomfort would vanish, just like it did in my past experiences. 

People say that's what you need to do for your growth, but I always wonder though, should we always feel this way?

Why can't we just feel comfortable all the time and grow along with it? Why can't comfort and growth coexist?
